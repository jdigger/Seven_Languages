Purpose
========
This is a place to work on the exercises in the book "Seven Languages In Seven Weeks."

Layout
========
There are two areas, jmoore and mmunhall, that then have subdirectories for each of the languages.

Because git doesn't store an empty directory, on initial setup, simply run (assuming bash/zsh):

`# mkdir -p {jmoore,mmunhall}/{ruby,io,prolog,scala,erlang,clojure,haskell}`
